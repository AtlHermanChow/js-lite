## Statsig Lite JavaScript Client SDK

A slimmed version of the [JavaScript](https://github.com/statsig-io/js-client) SDK for single user client environments. If you need an SDK for another language or server environment, check out our [other SDKs](https://docs.statsig.com/#sdks).

Statsig helps you move faster with feature gates (feature flags), and/or dynamic configs. It also allows you to run A/B/n tests to validate your new features and understand their impact on your KPIs.
